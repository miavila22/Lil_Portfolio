                <p>Another big thing about me is that I like to watch anime.
                    I was fortunate to grow up watching superhero shows and lots of anime.
                    I started with X-men then ventured off into other Marvel, DC and anime shows.
                    </p>

                <p>I love to exercise too though I never did it to look a certain way but rather
                    more of the mental benefits. I accept all the physical benefits that come with working out 
                    but that was never the reason why I started. It allows me to sleep, it gives me an appetite
                    and it allows me to focus.

                      <p> For as long as I have known, music has always been a huge part of my life. 
                        As a child, I was exposed to all types of music. The disco, funk and jazz
                        came from my father and the spanish rock, bachata and other mexican music
                        came from my mother. It wasn't until I was roughly in 4th or 5th grade that 
                        I discovered punk, post-harcore and other genres of rock that I still listen
                        this day. As I was watching bands play on tv, it was only a matter of time till
                        I picked up some instruments. The rest is history.
